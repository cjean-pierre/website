GenAI Impact is a community that highlights the environmental footprint of generative AI and offers solutions for its sustainable use. As it increasingly becomes a part of our daily lives, generative AI is emerging as a standard for economic players. However, when employed on a large scale, application systems based on this technology can have significant environmental repercussions.

Our objectives are to:

Better understand and quantify the environmental impacts of generative AI;

Raise awareness among users and decision-makers about these issues and promote reasoned practices;

Provide developers with tools to calculate these impacts and facilitate responsible decision-making.
